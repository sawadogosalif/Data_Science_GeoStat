# I. Component preparation for trade area analysis

## 1. Prepare a hexagonal grid over a selected territory

Form a hexagonal grid - given a diameter for the hexagons to build and a GeoDataFrame on the territory
Overlay the grid on top of the original territory GeoDataFrame


## 2. **Component Preparation for Trade Area Analysis**



 -Prep hexagonal grid over a selected territory

- Prep hexagonal-based aggregations over the available external data sources

- Worldpop data: Population data
- OSM data: Point of interest data
- Carto data: Consumer spending data & Socio-demographic data
- Unacast data Pitney Bowes points of interest data


### Construct a single file with all hexagonal-based data(grid + aggregations)

### Visualize the data

## Trade Area Analysis Execution

### Derive density

### Derive urbanicity

### Derive trade area distance

### Form a dataset for further analysis

### Visualize the data
